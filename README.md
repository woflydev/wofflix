# Obsidian Wofflix
A mish-mash of my favourite features from other themes all crammed into one because I'm tired of switching back and forth six million times a day. Built for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Installation
Make a new folder called wofflix in your Obsidian themes folder -> ``./obsidian/themes/wofflix/`` and put the ``manifest.json`` and ``theme.css`` files in.

If you had Obsidian open during installation, relaunch the application and go to ``Settings (ctrl+,) -> Appearance -> Themes`` and select ``wofflix`` from the dropdown.

## Features
- Integration with [Day Planner](https://github.com/lynchjames/obsidian-day-planner)
- Custom checkboxes
- Integration with [Task Collector](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-task-collector)
